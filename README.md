Internship Task 4 - Spam Email Detection using scikit-learn

📝 Internship Task 4 Report

🏢 Company: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

👤 Name: Uppumaguluri Chelsea Reena

🆔 Intern ID: CT04DF481

📚 Domain: Python Programming

⏳ Duration: 4 Weeks

📌 Task 4: Machine Learning Model Implementation

✅ Objective

To develop a predictive machine learning model using scikit-learn that classifies or predicts outcomes based on a given dataset. This project focuses on identifying spam messages using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and Naive Bayes classification.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

Python 3.x

pandas – for data loading and manipulation

scikit-learn – for machine learning (model building, evaluation)

TfidfVectorizer – for feature extraction from text

Visual Studio Code / Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Project Description

This project demonstrates the application of supervised learning and text classification using a dataset of email messages labeled as ham (non-spam) or spam. It includes the following steps:

📂 Load spam.csv dataset

✂️ Clean and preprocess text data

🔠 Vectorize text using TF-IDF

🧠 Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier

📊 Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

🖼️ Display results in the terminal

📁 Files Included

File Name	Description
task-4.py	Python script for spam detection model
spam.csv	Input dataset of labeled messages
screenshot.png	Execution screenshot showing accuracy & metrics
README.md (optional)	Documentation for setup and usage

▶ How to Run

1. Install Required Libraries
bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn

3. Run the Script 
bash
python task-4.py
Ensure spam.csv is in the same directory as the script.

4. Output
   
Model accuracy (~96.68%) and classification report will be printed in the terminal.

✅ Outcome
